Description: Estimation and other utilities for trimmed distributions.
    Trimmed distributions are useful for bounded random variables, 
    and include two distinct trimming methods: 
    (1) Rectification is useful for random variables having reachable bounds.
        It assigns a non-zero probability mass to each bound by using 
        the cdf of the parent untrimmed distribution.
    (2) Truncation is useful for random variables having unreachable bounds.
        It assigns a zero pdf outside of the bounds and rescale the pdf
        to ensure it integrates to one.
